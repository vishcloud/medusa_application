/**
 * This workflow deletes one or more stores.
 *
 * :::note
 *
 * By default, Medusa uses a single store. This is useful
 * if you're building a multi-tenant application or a marketplace where each tenant has its own store.
 * If you delete the only store in your application, the Medusa application will re-create it on application start-up.
 *
 * :::
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to
 * delete stores within your custom flows.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await deleteStoresWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     ids: ["store_123"]
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Delete one or more stores.
