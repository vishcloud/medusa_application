/**
 * This workflow lists the shipping options of a cart. It's executed by the
 * [List Shipping Options Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#shipping-options_getshippingoptions).
 *
 * :::note
 *
 * This workflow doesn't retrieve the calculated prices of the shipping options. If you need to retrieve the prices of the shipping options,
 * use the {@link listShippingOptionsForCartWithPricingWorkflow} workflow.
 *
 * :::
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around to retrieve the shipping options of a cart
 * in your custom flows.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await listShippingOptionsForCartWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     cart_id: "cart_123",
 *     option_ids: ["so_123"]
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * List a cart's shipping options.
